# Introduction

* We present our bpbounds R package and Shiny web app for the nonparametric bounds for the average causal effect (ACE) due to Balke and Pearl [@bpbounds-package]. 
* This is an R implementation of our Stata programs [@palmer-sj-2011].
* The package can be installed from CRAN as follows:
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bpbounds")
```

* Code development is on the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/remlapmot/bpbounds

# Methods

* Under the instrumental variable assumptions alone, without additional parametric model assumptions, the ACE is not identified. 
* @balke-jasa-1997 showed it is possible to derive bounds for the ACE.
* The bounds have the following interpretation: 

> There is some joint distribution of the unobserved confounders and the observed variables that yields a true ACE as small as the lower bound, while another choice produces an ACE as large as the upper bounds (the bounds are tight).

* There are at least two ways to implement the Balke-Pearl bounds:

i) using conditional probabilities calculated from contingency tables;
ii) the polytope method due to @dawid-hsss-2003.

* We implemented the polytope method since it is generalisable for identified IV models with exposures, outcomes, and instruments with more than 2 categories.
* Currently, we allow for a binary or 3 category instrument, and binary exposure and outcome.

# Example Mendelian randomization analysis

* We extract an example from @meleady-ajcn-2003. 
* We have a 3 category instrument and binary exposure and outcome. 
* We use the 677CT polymorphism (rs1801133) in the MTHFR gene, involved in folate metabolism, as an instrumental variable to investigate the causal effect of homocysteine on the risk of cardiovascular disease.
* The code is shown on the right.
* The ACE lies between a risk difference of -9% to 74% increase in absolute risk.
* Additionally, we see that the monotonicity inequality is not satisfied.

# Conclusion

* Use of bounds in instrumental variable analyses is regaining interest [@swanson-jasa-2018; @labrecque-cer-2018].
* The empirical experience that the bounds are often wide is not a bad property of the method, it is a property of the typical data: Mendelian randomization data simply often are uninformative in that sense due to weak instrumental variables.
* We recommend using the bounds when the variables are genuinely discrete, but not when the exposure is genuinely continuous [@sheehan-hg-2019].
* Our R package and app provide a convenient interface to the bounds.
